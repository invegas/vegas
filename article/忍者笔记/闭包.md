# 什么是闭包

> a closure  is the scope created when a function is declared that allows the
function  to  access  and  manipulate  variables  that  are  external  to  that  function.  Put
another way, closures allow a function to access all the variables, as well as other func -tions, that are in scope when the function itself is declared.


> When  we  declared innerFunction()  inside  the  outer  function,  not  only  was  the  func -tion declaration defined, but a closure was also created that encompasses not only the
function declaration, but also all variables that are in scope  at the point of the declaration.

当一个函数声明时，一个闭包同时创建了，不仅包括当前这个函数，而且包括这个函数声明作用域内的变量

> When innerFunction() eventually executes, even if it’s executed  after  the scope in
which  it  was  declared  goes  away,  it  has  access  to  the  original  scope  in  which  it  was declared through its closure

函数可以访问它在声明时的闭包，保留现场？
